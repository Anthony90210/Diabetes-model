The goal of this work is to combine five different models using Bagging and Boosting ensemble learning methods so as to create and accurate model for detecting diabetes in individuals utilizing clinical data.
The machine learning algorithms to be trained with a dataset in this report include Decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbour (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Our model is compared with some recent study and the results show that the proposed model can provide better accuracy of 99% based on our dataset and the adopted ML algorithm.
We performed Bagging and Boosting learning techniques to our different models to create an even more accurate result.  
The results of this study suggest that Random forest can provide a high level of accuracy in predicting Diabetes based on clinical data with accuracy percentage of 99.
